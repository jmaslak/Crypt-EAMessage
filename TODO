If you are looking for ways to help:

* Add tests!
  * Check error messages when bad keys are provided
  * Check that system throws exceptions when methods are called with the
    wrong number/type of parameters (extend tests in 05-calling.t)
  * Does the module properly handle UTF-8 wide characters and such?
  * If you write a test that should pass, but there is a bug, make it a
    TODO test so it doesn't break the build - but I would love those
    kinds of tests!
* File encryption routines - for all routines have a variant that works
  with files as input or output or both.
* Better Corinna support.  Look for a "serialize" method and use
  "deserialize" parameter on the receiving side.
